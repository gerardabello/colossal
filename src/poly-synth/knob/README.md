# React Knob

A simple knob for React components.

```javascript
  npm install react-knob
```

## Usage

Activated by tabbing to it or by hovering over and scrolling.

I've included a sample scss file. Feel free to use it or style it yourself.

### Props

- `value` (required)
- `onChangeValue` (optional)

```javascript
import Knob from 'react-knob'

<Knob value={5} onChangeValue={this.handleChange} />
```
