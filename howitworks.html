    <h1>How Colossal works</h1>
    Colossal is a subtractive synthesizer. Here I will not explain the basics of sound synthesis, only the specific design of this synthesizer.
    <h2>Voice</h2>
    <p>The sound Colossal outputs is a combination of voices. In polyphony (multiple notes at the same time), each voice is a note. In monophony, a single voice plays all notes, one at a time.</p>
