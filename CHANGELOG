Version 0.1.0
- Initial release

Version 0.1.1
- Extend virual piano keyboard up to E-5
- Don't pay notes when keys are pressed with modifiers held down
  so key combinations like ctrl+L (PC) or cmd+L (Mac) to focus
  URL bar don't also play notes.
- Unstick notes triggered by text keypress after 1.5 seconds
  without a keydown event triggerd by auto-repeat while the key
  is held down.
- Stop events from bubbling for keydown events that cause notes
  to be played so they don't end up also triggering other things
  such as browser plugins for vim-like, keyboard-driven browser
  navigation.

Version 0.1.2
- Don't stop chord notes playing in attempt to stop playing
  stuck-key notes.
