    <h1>How Colossal works</h1>
    <p>Colossal is a subtractive synthesizer. Here I will not explain the basics of sound synthesis, only the specific design of this synthesizer.</p>
    <h2>Voice</h2>
    <p>The sound Colossal outputs is a combination of voices. In polyphony (multiple notes at the same time), each voice is a note. In monophony, a single voice plays all notes, one at a time.</p>
    <img src="main.png" alt="Structure of a single voice">
    <p>It has a simple structure. The same note is sent to two oscillators, their outputs get mixed, and then the signal goes through a filter and a gain, both controlled by it's own envelope.</p>


    <h2>Mixer</h2>
    <h2>Envelope</h2>
    <p>The envelopes use the exponentialRampToValueAtTime() function to create a typical ADSR envelope shape. The only problem is that if the note finishes before the attack or decay phase, we dont know the last output of the envelope. We need that value because the release phase starts at the last value (the envelope must be continuous). To obtain that value it uses an analyser node. It is not pretty, but at the moment I am not aware of any method to obtain the current value during an exponentialRampToValueAtTime().
